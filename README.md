# Tyre-Compound-Analysis
## Overview

The Tyre Compound Analysis tool is a specialised simulation and analysis framework designed to evaluate the performance of various tyre compounds under different conditions. By modelling parameters such as grip levels, degradation rates, and thermal properties, this tool provides motorsport teams with actionable insights to optimise tyre strategies.

## Features

- **Compound-Specific Analysis**: Simulate and compare performance metrics for multiple tyre compounds.
- **Thermal Modelling**: Analyse heat build-up and dissipation based on driving conditions.
- **Grip and Degradation Simulation**: Model tyre wear and performance over a race distance.
- **Customisable Parameters**: Configure compound-specific and environmental factors.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Generate comparative plots for performance metrics across compounds.
